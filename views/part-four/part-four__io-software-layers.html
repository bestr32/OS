      <h3>I/O Software Layers</h3>
      <p>
        I/O software is typically organized in four layers. Each layer has a
        well-defined function to perform, as well as an interface to the
        adjacent layers.
      </p>
      <p>Highest to lowest:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>User-level I/O software</li>
        <li>Device-independent operating system software</li>
        <li>Device drivers</li>
        <li>Interrupt handlers</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Interrupt Handlers</h4>
      <p>
        While programmed I/O is occasionally useful, for most I/O, interrupts
        are an unpleasant fact of life and cannot be avoided.
      </p>
      <p>
        They should be hidden away, deep in the bowels of the operating system,
        so that as little of the operating system as possible knows about them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best way to hide them is to have the driver starting an I/O
        operation block until the I/O has completed and the interrupt occurs.
      </p>

      <h4>Device Drivers</h4>
      <p>
        each I/O device attached to a computer needs some device-specific code
        for controlling it. This code, called the
        <strong>device driver</strong>, is generally written by the deviceâ€™s
        manufacturer and delivered along with the device.
      </p>

      <h4>Device-Independent I/O Software</h4>
      <p>
        Although some of the I/O software is device specific, other parts of it
        are device independent.
      </p>
      <p>The device-independent software usually does:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Uniform interfacing for device drivers.</li>
        <li>Buffering.</li>
        <li>Error reporting</li>
        <li>Allocating and releasing dedicated devices.</li>
        <li>Providing a device-independent block size.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>User-Space I/O Software</h4>
      <p>
        Although most of the I/O software is within the operating system, a
        small portion of it consists of libraries linked together with user
        programs, and even whole programs running outside the kernel. System
        calls, including the I/O system calls, are normally made by library
        procedures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not all user-level I/O software consists of library procedures. Another
        important category is the spooling system. <strong>Spooling</strong> is
        a way of dealing with dedicated I/O devices in a multiprogramming
        system.
