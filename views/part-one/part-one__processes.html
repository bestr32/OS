      <p>
        All modern computers often do several things at the same time. People
        used to working with computers may not be fully aware of this fact, so a
        few examples may make the point clearer.
      </p>

      <p>
        First consider a Web server. Requests come in from all over asking for
        Web pages. When a request comes in, the server checks to see if the page
        needed is in the cache. If it is, it is sent back; if it is not, a disk
        request is started to fetch it. However, from the CPUâ€™s perspective,
        disk requests take eternity.
      </p>
      <p>
        While waiting for a disk request to complete, many more requests may
        come in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clearly some way is needed to model and control this concurrency.
        Processes (and especially threads) can help here.
      </p>
      <p>
        In any multiprogramming system, the CPU switches from process to process
        quickly, running each for tens or hundreds of milliseconds. While,
        strictly speaking, at any one instant the CPU is running only one
        process, in the course of 1 second it may work on several of them,
        giving the illusion of parallelism. Sometimes people speak of
        <strong>pseudoparallelism</strong> in this context, to contrast it with
        the true hardware parallelism of <strong>multiprocessor</strong> systems
        (which have two or more CPUs sharing the same physical memory).
      </p>

      <h3>The Process Model</h3>
      <p>
        In this model, all the runnable software on the computer, sometimes
        including the operating system, is organized into a number of sequential
        processes, or just processes for short.
      </p>
      <p>
        A process is just an instance of an executing program, including the
        current values of the program counter, registers, and variables.
        Conceptually, each process has its own virtual CPU. In reality, of
        course, the real CPU switches back and forth from process to process,
        but to understand the system, it is much easier to think about a
        collection of processes running in (pseudo) parallel than to try to keep
        track of how the CPU switches from program to program.
      </p>
      <p>
        This rapid switching back and forth is called
        <strong>multiprogramming</strong>.
      </p>

      <h4>Difference between a Process and a Program</h4>
      <p>
        It is crucial to understand the difference between a process and a
        program. A program is a static entity, the code that sits on the disk
        waiting to be run.
      </p>
      <p>
        A process is a dynamic entity, it is the program in execution. Hence, we
        care about its state, how it is being executed, how much memory is
        allocated to it, etc.
      </p>
      <p>If a program is running twice, it counts as two processes.</p>

      <h4>Process Creation</h4>
      <p>
        Operating systems need some way to create processes. In very simple
        systems, or in systems designed for running only a single application
        (e.g., the controller in a microwave oven), it may be possible to have
        all the processes that will ev er be needed be present when the system
        comes up. In general-purpose systems, however, some way is needed to
        create and terminate processes as needed during operation.
      </p>
      <p>Four principal events cause processes to be created:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>System initialization</li>
        <li>
          Execution of a process-creation system call by a running process.
        </li>
        <li>A user requrest to create a new process</li>
        <li>Initiation of a batch job.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        When an OS is booted, numeroues processes are created. Some of these are
        foreground (interact with human), others run in the background (called
        <strong>daemons</strong>).
      </p>

      <h4>Process Termination</h4>
      <p>
        After a process has been created, it starts running and does whatever
        its job is. However, nothing lasts forever, not even processes. Sooner
        or later the new process will terminate, usually due to one of the
        following conditions:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Normal exit (voluntary).</li>
        <li>Error exit (voluntary)</li>
        <li>Fatal error (involuntary).</li>
        <li>Killed by another process (involuntary).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Most processes terminate because they have done their work (normal
        exit).
      </p>
      <p>Error exits happen because of bad parameters.</p>
      <p>
        Fatal errors happen because of a program bug (division by 0, illegal
        instruction, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
        And a different process might execute a system call to kill some other
        process.
      </p>

      <h4>Process Hierarchies</h4>
      <p>
        In some systems, when a process creates another process, the parent
        process and child process continue to be associated in certain ways. The
        child process can itself create more processes, forming a process
        hierarchy.
      </p>

      <h4>Process States</h4>
      <p>A process may be in any of three states:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Running. Currently has CPU time.</li>
        <li>Ready. Ready to run but waiting for the CPU (no CPU available).</li>
        <li>
          Blocked. Unable to run until some external event happens (I/O
          operation).
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Implementation of Processes</h4>
      <p>
        The OS maintains a table (an array of structures) called the
        <strong>process table</strong> with one entry per process.
      </p>
      <p>This entry is called a <strong>process control block</strong>.</p>
      <p>
        It contains important information about the process' state, its program
        counter, stack pointer, memory allocation, the status of its open files
        and everything else about the process that must be saved when the
        process is switched from running to ready or blocked state so that it
        can be restarted later as if it had never been stopped.
      </p>
