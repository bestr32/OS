      <p>A deadlock can be defined formally as follows:</p>
      <p class="quote">
        A set of processes is deadlocked if each process in the set is waiting
        for an event that only another process in the set can cause.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because all the processes are waiting, none of them will ever cause any
        event that could wake up any of the other members of the set, and all
        the processes continue to wait forever.
      </p>

      <h4>Conditions for Resource Deadlocks</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Mutual exclusion condition. Each resource is either currently assigned
          to exactly one process or is available.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hold-and-wait condition. Processes currently holding resources that
          were granted earlier can request new resources.
        </li>
        <li>
          No-preemption condition. Resources previously granted cannot be
          forcibly taken away from a process.
        </li>
        <li>
          Circular wait condition. There must be a circular list of two or more
          processes, each of which is waiting for a resource held by the next
          member of the chain.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        All four of these conditions must be present for a resource deadlock to
        occur. If one of them is absent, no resource deadlock is possible.
      </p>
      <p>Four strategies are used for dealing with deadlocks:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Ostrich algorithm: ignore the problem. Maybe if you ignore it it will
          ignore you.
        </li>
        <li>
          Detection and recovery. Let them occur, detect them, take action.
        </li>
        <li>Dynamic avoidance by careful resource allocation.</li>
        <li>
          Prevention, by structurally negating one of the four conditions.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>The simplest approach is the ostrich algorithm: stick your head in the sand and pretend there is no problem.</p>
