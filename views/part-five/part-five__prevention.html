      <p>
        Having seen that deadlock avoidance is essentially impossible, because
        it requires information about future requests, which is not known, how
        do real systems avoid deadlock?
      </p>
      <p>
        The answer is to go back to the four conditions that must be met for a
        deadlock to occur. If we can ensure that at least one of these
        conditions is never satisfied, then deadlocks will be structurally
        impossible.
      </p>

      <h4>Attacking the Mutual-Exclusion Condition</h4>
      <p>
        If no resource were ever assigned exclusively to a single process, we
        would never have deadlocks.
      </p>
      <p>
        For data, the simplest method is to make data read only, so that
        processes can use the data concurrently. However, it is equally clear
        that allowing two processes to write on the printer at the same time
        will lead to chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
        By spooling printer output, several processes can generate output at the
        same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Avoid assigning a resource unless absolutely necessary, and try to make
        sure that as few processes as possible may actually claim the resource.
      </p>

      <h4>Attacking the Hold-and-Wait Condition</h4>
      <p>
        If we can prevent processes that hold resources from waiting for more
        resources, we can eliminate deadlocks.
      </p>
      <p>
        One way to achieve this goal is to require all processes to request all
        their resources before starting execution.
      </p>
      <p>
        If ev erything is available, the process will be allocated whatever it
        needs and can run to completion. If one or more resources are busy,
        nothing will be allocated and the process will just wait.
      </p>
      <p>
        An immediate problem with this approach is that many processes do not
        know how many resources they will need until they hav e started running.
        In fact, if they knew, the bankerâ€™s algorithm could be used.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another problem is that resources will not be used optimally with this
        approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        A slightly different way to break the hold-and-wait condition is to
        require a process requesting a resource to first temporarily release all
        the resources it currently holds. Then it tries to get everything it
        needs all at once.
      </p>

      <h4>Attacking the No-Preemption Condition</h4>
      <p>
        Attacking the third condition (no preemption) is also a possibility. If
        a process has been assigned the printer and is in the middle of printing
        its output, forcibly taking away the printer because a needed plotter is
        not available is tricky at best and impossible at worst.
      </p>
      <p>However, some resources can be virtualized to avoid this situation.</p>
      <p>
        Spooling printer output to the disk and allowing only the printer daemon
        access to the real printer eliminates deadlocks involving the printer,
        although it creates a potential for deadlock over disk space. With large
        disks though, running out of disk space is unlikely.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, not all resources can be virtualized like this. For example,
        records in databases or tables inside the operating system must be
        locked to be used and therein lies the potential for deadlock.
      </p>

      <h4>Attacking the Circular Wait Condition</h4>
      <p>The circular wait can be eliminated in several ways.</p>
      <p>
        One way is simply to have a rule saying that a process is entitled only
        to a single resource at any moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it needs a second one, it must release the first one. For a process
        that needs to copy a huge file from a tape to a printer, this
        restriction is unacceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another way to avoid the circular wait is to provide a global numbering
        of all the resources, so that processes can request resources whenever
        they want to, but all requests must be made in numerical order.
      </p>
