      <p>
        <strong>Files</strong> are logical units of information created by
        processes. A disk will usually contain thousands or even millions of
        them, each one independent of the others.
      </p>

      <p>
        Processes can read existing files and create new ones if need be.
        Information stored in files must be <strong>persistent</strong>, that
        is, not be affected by process creation and termination.
      </p>

      <p>
        Files are managed by the operating system. How they are structured,
        named, accessed, used, protected, implemented, and managed are major
        topics in operating system design.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a whole, that part of the operating system dealing with files is
        known as the <strong>file system</strong>.
      </p>

      <div class="quote">
        <p>
          From the userâ€™s standpoint, the most important aspect of a file system
          is how it appears, in other words, what constitutes a file, how files
          are named and protected, what operations are allowed on files, and so
          on.
        </p>
        <p>
          The details of whether linked lists or bitmaps are used to keep track
          of free storage and how many sectors there are in a logical disk block
          are of no interest, although they are of great importance to the
          designers of the file system.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>Files From the User's Perspective</h3>

      <h4>File Naming</h4>
      <p>
        A file is an abstraction mechanism. It provides a way to store
        information on the disk and read it back later.
      </p>

      <p>
        This must be done in such a way as to shield the user from the details
        of how and where the information is stored, and how the disks actually
        work.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a process creates a file, it gives the file a name. When the
        process terminates, the file continues to exist and can be accessed by
        other processes using its name.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many operating systems support two-part file names, with the two parts
        separated by a period, as in <i>prog.c</i>. The part following the
        period is called the <strong>file extension</strong> and usually
        indicates something about the file.
      </p>

      <h4>File Structure</h4>
      <p>Files can be structured in several ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Unstructured sequence of bytes. All the OS sees are bytes - it does
          not care what is in the file. Used by UNIX & Windows.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sequence of fixed-length records, each record with some internal
          structure.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tree of records, each containing a key field in a fixed position in
          the record. Used by large mainframe PCs.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>File Types</h4>
      <p>
        Many operating systems support several types of files. UNIX & Windows
        have regular files and directories.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Regular files</strong> are the ones that contain user
        information.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Directories</strong> are system files for maintaining the
        structure of the FS.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Character special files</strong> are related to input/output and
        used to model serial I/O devices.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Block special files</strong> are used to model disks.</p>

      <br />

      <p>Regular files are generally either ASCII files or binary files.</p>
      <p>
        ASCII files consist of lines of text. In some systems each line is
        terminated by a carriage return character. In others, the line feed
        character is used. Some systems (e.g., Windows) use both. Lines need not
        all be of the same length.
      </p>
      <p>
        The great advantage of ASCII files is that they can be displayed and
        printed as is, and they can be edited with any text editor. Furthermore,
        if large numbers of programs use ASCII files for input and output, it is
        easy to connect the output of one program to the input of another, as in
        shell pipelines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Binary files - simply means that they are not ASCII files. Listing them
        on a printer gives a listing full of random junk, although they have an
        internal structure known to programs that use them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every operating system must recognize at least one file type: its own
        executable file; some recognize more.
      </p>

      <h4>File Access</h4>
      <p>
        Early operating systems provided only one kind of file access:
        <strong> sequential access</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In these systems, a process could read all the bytes or records in a
        file in order, starting at the beginning, but could not skip around and
        read them out of order.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sequential files could be rewound, however, so they could be read as
        often as needed. Sequential files were convenient when the storage
        medium was magnetic tape rather than disk.
      </p>
      <p>
        When disks came into use for storing files, it became possible to read
        the bytes or records of a file out of order, or to access records by key
        rather than by position.
      </p>
      <p>
        Files whose bytes or records can be read in any order are called
        <strong>random-access files</strong>. They are required by many
        applications.
      </p>

      <h4>File Attributes</h4>
      <p>
        Every file has a name and its data. In addition, all OS associate other
        info with each file (e.g. date&time last modified, file size)
      </p>
      <p>
        These extra items are the file's <strong>attributes</strong> (metadata).
      </p>

      <h4>File Operations</h4>
      <p>
        Files exist to store information and allow it to be retrieved later.
        OS's provide different operations to allow storage and retrieval.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Create. The file is created with no data. Announces that the file is
          coming.
        </li>
        <li>
          Delete. When the file is no longer needed, it has to be deleted to
          free up disk.
        </li>
        <li>Open. Before using a file, a process must open it.</li>
        <li>
          Close. When all the accesses are finished, the file should be closed
          to free up internal table space.
        </li>
        <li>
          Read. Data are read from file. Usually, the bytes come from the
          current position.
        </li>
        <li>
          Write. Data are written to the file again, usually at the current
          position.
        </li>
        <li>Append, Seek, Get Attributes, Set Attributes, Rename.</li>
      </ol>
