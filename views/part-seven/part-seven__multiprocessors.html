      <p>
        A <strong>shared-memory multiprocessor</strong> is a computer system in
        which two or more CPUs share full access to a common RAM.
      </p>
      <p>
        A program running on any of the CPUs sees a normal (usually paged)
        virtual address space.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only unusual property this system has is that the CPU can write some
        value into a memory word and then read the work back and get a different
        value (because another CPU has changed it).
      </p>
      <p>
        When organized correctly, this property forms the basis of
        interprocessor communication - one CPU writes some data into memory and
        another one reads the data out.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the most part, multiprocessor operating systems are normal operating
        systems. They handle system calls, do memory management, provide a file
        system, and manage I/O devices. Nevertheless, there are some areas in
        which they hav e unique features. These include process synchronization,
        resource management, and scheduling.
      </p>

      <h4>Multiprocessor Hardware</h4>
      <p>
        Although all multiprocessors have the property that every CPU can
        address all of memory, some multiprocessors have the additional property
        that every memory word can be read as fast as every other memory word.
      </p>
      <p>
        These machines are called <strong>UMA</strong> (<strong
          >Uniform Memory Access</strong
        >) multiprocessors.
      </p>
      <p>
        In contrast, <strong>NUMA</strong> (<strong
          >Nonuniform Memory Access</strong
        >) multiprocessors do not have this property.
      </p>

      <h4>UMA Multiprocessors with Bus-Based Architectures</h4>
      <p>
        The simplest multiprocessors are based on a single bus. Two or more CPUs
        and one or more memory modules all use the same bus for communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a CPU wants to read a memory word, it first checks to see if the
        bus is busy. If the bus is idle, the CPU puts the address of the word it
        wants on the bus, asserts a few control signals, and waits until the
        memory puts the desired word on the bus.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the bus is busy when a CPU wants to read or write memory, the CPU
        just waits until the bus becomes idle.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a couple of CPUs this is not a problem, but with something like 32
        or 64 CPUs the system will be totally limited by the bandwidth of the
        bus and most of the CPUs will be idle most of the time.
      </p>
      <p>The solution to this problem is to add a cache to each CPU.</p>

      <h4>UMA Multiprocessors Using Crossbar Switches</h4>
      <p>
        Even with the best caching, the use of a single bus limits the size of a
        UMA multiprocessor to about 16 or 32 CPUs.
      </p>

      <h4>NUMA Multiprocessors</h4>
      <p>
        Single-bus UMA multiprocessors are generally limited to no more than a
        few dozen CPUs, and crossbar or switched multiprocessors need a lot of
        expensive hardware and are not THAT much bigger. To get more than 100
        CPUs, something has to give.
      </p>
      <p>
        Usually, what gives is the idea that all memory modules have the same
        access time.
      </p>
      <p>
        This concession leads to the idea of NUMA multiprocessors, as mentioned
        above. Like their UMA cousins, they provide a single address space
        across all the CPUs, but unlike the UMA machines, access to local memory
        modules is faster than access to remote ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus all UMA programs will run without change on NUMA machines, but the
        performance will be worse than on a UMA machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        NUMA machines have three key characteristics that all of them possess
        and which together distinguish them from other multiprocessors:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>There is a single address space visible to all CPUs</li>
        <li>Access to remote memory is via LOAD and STORE instructions.</li>
        <li>Access to remote memory is slower than access to local memory.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        When the access time to remote memory is not hidden (because there is no
        caching), the system is called NC-NUMA (Non Cache-coherent NUMA). When
        the caches are coherent, the system is called CC-NUMA (Cache-Coherent
        NUMA).
      </p>

      <h4>Multiprocessor OS Types</h4>
      <p>
        The simplest possible way to organize a multiprocessor OS is to
        statically divide memory into as many partitions as there are CPUs and
        give each CPU its own private memory and its own private copy of the
        operating system.
      </p>
      <p>
        A second model is to have one copy of the OS and its tables present on
        CPU 1 and not on any of the others. All system calls are redirected to
        CPU 1 for processing there. CPU 1 may also run user processes if there
        is CPU time left over. This model is called
        <strong>master-slave</strong> since CPU 1 is the master and all the
        others are slaves.
      </p>
      <p>
        A third model is the SMP (Symmetric Multiprocessor), where there is ony
        copy of the OS in memory, but any CPU can run it. When a system call is
        made, the CPU on which the system call was made traps to the kernel and
        processes the system call.
